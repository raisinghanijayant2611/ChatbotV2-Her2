# ChatbotV2-Her2


This project is developed as a part of an assignment: 

We need to develop a Q/A chatbot prototype that can effectively address questions related to this publication. This prototype should be implemented in Python using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM). Additionally, we require a comprehensive evaluation approach to assess the chatbot's performance.


# How to install the Chatbot:

Need python environment >= 3.11.10

Please clone the repo:
<pip install -r requirements.txt>

Please use streamlit to run the chatbot:
