what does table 1 describe,"
Table 1 in the research paper describes the results of a study on the amplification of the HER-2/neu gene in various types of cancer cells. The table includes data on the amplification of the gene in different cell types, as well as the time frame in which the amplification occurred. The study found that the HER-2/neu gene is present in many proto-oncogenes and is related to the tyrosine-specific protein kinase family. Through transfection studies, the gene was identified as a potential transforming gene in rat neuroglioblastomas. Further research revealed that the HER-2/neu gene is also present in human DNA and is related to the c-erbB proto-oncogene. The table also shows that the HER-2/neu gene is amplified five- to ten-fold in a mammary carcinoma cell line, suggesting its potential role in cancer development. ",0
what does table 2 describe,"
Table 2 in the research paper titled ""Amplification and Overexpression of the HER-2/neu Gene in Human Breast Cancer"" describes the results of a study on the amplification and overexpression of the HER-2/neu gene in human breast cancer. The table presents data on the correlation between HER-2/neu gene amplification and overexpression, and the response to treatment in patients with breast cancer. It also shows the number of copies of the HER-2/neu gene in tumor cells and how they correlate with patient survival rates. Additionally, the table also displays the results of statistical analysis on the data collected from the study.",0
